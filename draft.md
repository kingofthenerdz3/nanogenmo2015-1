# The Lair of Crimax
A generated gamebook.
By Mark Rickerby for NaNoGenMo2015.
## Prologue

Throughout your journey in this land, you’ve heard whispered tales of a spreading darkness that grow increasingly unhinged as you get closer to the village of Redthorn.

The tales tell of Crimax, a corrupt dark wizard whose foul magic is spreading to the surface. The villagers plead with you to help fight this menace before the darkness takes its toll.

Somewhere near Redthorn is the entrance to Crimax’s lair. Others have found riches in treasure there, though many who enter are never seen again.

- To search for the entrance and ENTER the dungeon, turn to **§1**.

## §1

You are in a prison. There is a monster here: SLIME (STRENGTH: 6, STAMINA: 7). It seems afraid of you. Make a successful attack roll to scare it off.

- If you fail, you must FIGHT. You gain initiative.
