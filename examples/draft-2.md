# The Caverns under Willen

A generated gamebook.

By Mark Rickerby for NaNoGenMo2015.

## Prologue

It is said that a plague has come upon these lands. You’ve heard stories of a chilling shadow which get increasingly alarming as you get closer to the village of Willen.

The rumours tell of Ungon, a corrupt dark wizard whose malevolent influence is spreading to the surface. The people of Willen implore you to help fight this menace before the darkness takes its toll.

Somewhere near Willen is the entrance to Ungon’s lair. Some may have found fortunes there, though many who enter are never seen again.
