# The Wizard of Orm

A generated gamebook.

By Mark Rickerby for NaNoGenMo2015.

## Prologue

Throughout your journey in these lands, you’ve heard subtle rumours of a lurking darkness that grow increasingly unhinged as you get closer to the village of Orm.

The stories tell of Scius, a depraved dark wizard whose fell magic is spreading above ground. The people of Orm insist that you must help fight this menace before the darkness takes its toll.

The entrance to Scius’s lair is behind a waterfall on the outskirts of Orm. Some have found fortunes in treasure and gold there, though many are never seen again.
